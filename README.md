A lightweight REST API for controlling Linux audio and media players, built in Go. Provides unified interfaces for MPRIS media players, PulseAudio/PipeWire audio control, and systemd service management.

**Target Environment:** Designed for multimedia systems running with a user session (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR). Ideal for headless music servers, home audio systems, and dedicated media players.

## Features

### Media Player Control (MPRIS)
- List and control MPRIS-compatible media players (Spotify, VLC, Firefox, etc.)
- Full playback control: play, pause, stop, next, previous
- Volume and position control
- Shuffle and loop mode management
- Real-time player state updates via D-Bus signals
- Smart caching with automatic cache invalidation
- Position heartbeat for accurate playback tracking

### Audio Management (PulseAudio/PipeWire)
- List audio sinks and sources
- Volume control for sink-inputs only
- Real-time audio events via native PulseAudio monitoring
- Limited PipeWire support with pipewire-pulse

### Service Management (systemd)
- List and monitor systemd services
- Enable, disable, and restart services
- Real-time service state updates via D-Bus signals
- Headless tracking via filesystem monitoring (for systemd without utmp)
- User session detection based on DESKTOP environment variable

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/b0bbywan/go-odio-api.git
cd go-odio-api

# Build
go build -o odio-api

# Run
./odio-api
```

### systemd User Service

To run as a systemd user service, create `~/.config/systemd/user/odio-api.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Dbus api for Odio
Documentation=https://github.com/b0bbywan/go-odio-api
Wants=sound.target
After=sound.target
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/odio-api
Restart=always
RestartSec=12
TimeoutSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then enable and start the service:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable odio-api.service
systemctl --user start odio-api.service
```

## Configuration

Configuration file can be placed at:
- `/etc/odio-api/config.yaml` (system-wide)
- `~/.config/odio-api/config.yaml` (user-specific)
- A default configuration is available in `share/config.yaml`

Disabling a backend will disable its routes !

Example configuration:

```yaml
services:
  enabled: true
  system:
    - bluetooth.service
    - upmpdcli.service
  user:
    - mpd.service
    - pipewire-pulse.service
    - pulseaudio.service
    - shairport-sync.service
    - snapclient.service
    - spotifyd.service

pulseaudio:
  enabled: true

mpris:
  enabled: true
  timeout: 5s

api:
  enabled: true
  port: 8080

logLevel: warn
```

## Architecture

### Backends

The application uses a modular backend architecture:

- **MPRIS Backend**: Communicates with media players via D-Bus, implements smart caching and real-time updates through D-Bus signals
- **PulseAudio Backend**: Interacts with PulseAudio/PipeWire for audio control, supports real-time event monitoring
- **Systemd Backend**: Manages systemd services via D-Bus with native signal-based monitoring

### Key Components

- **Cache System**: Optimized caching with TTL support to minimize D-Bus calls
- **Event Listeners**: Real-time monitoring via D-Bus signals for instant state updates
- **Heartbeat**: Automatic position tracking for playing media without constant polling
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean resource cleanup on application termination

### Performance Optimizations

- Smart caching reduces D-Bus calls by ~90%
- Batch property retrieval (GetAll vs individual Gets)
- D-Bus signal-based updates instead of polling
- Automatic heartbeat management for position tracking
- Connection pooling and timeout handling
